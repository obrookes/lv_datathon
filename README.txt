Problem is the same as mentioned in presentation, just a new dataset. Still a supervised regression problem.

Predict 'Total Claim Amount' given the features.
Target is continuous.

Split new_train.csv however you like to train and validate your model a new_test.csv will be day sent of presentation to test models on. 
MAE will be used to measure performance. Bonus points for a valid argument for another metric.
Methods to explain / simplify your models are of equal interest!


categorical_features = ['Country', 'State Code', 'State', 'Response', 'Coverage', 'Education', 'EmploymentStatus', 'Gender', 'Location Code', 'Marital Status', 'Policy Type', 'Policy', 'Claim Reason', 'Sales Channel', 'Vehicle Class', 'Vehicle Size']
